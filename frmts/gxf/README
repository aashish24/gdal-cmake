Gilles Clement of Global Geomatics approved this support library
for general OpenSource release six months after it was released
as part of OGDI.  This should be approximately September of 1999. 


GXF Irregularities
------------------

 o The #TRANSFORM is defined to have commas between fields, but in the
   example files it has spaces.  Treating both the same.

 o The document doesn't memtion it, but it seems that the first five
   characters have to be taken as sufficient for a field name.  For 
   instance the old sample file I have has only #TITL for the title,
   while new ones have #TITLE.
