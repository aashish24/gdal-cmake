<h1>RST --- Idrisi Raster Format</h1>

This format is basically a raw one. There is just one band
per files, except in the RGB24 data type where the Red, Green and Blue bands
are store interleafed by pixels in the order Blue, Green and Red. The others data
type are unsigned 8 bits integer with values from 0 to 255 or signed 16 bits integer
with values from -32.768 to 32.767 or 32 bits single precision floating point.32
bits. The description of the file is stored in a companying text file. This description
doesn&#8217;t include color table or detailed geographic referencing
information, but it point to a file in the software installation folders that
holds the geographic reference details. The color table can be determined by
another companying file if it exists; otherwise it is also given be files in
the installation folder. Therefore the presence or absence of the Idrisi
software in the running operation system will determine the way that this
format driver will work.</p>
