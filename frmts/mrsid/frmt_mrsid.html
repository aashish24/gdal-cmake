<h1>MrSID --- Multi-resolution Seamless Image Database</h1>

MrSID is a wavelet-based image compression technology which can utilise both
lossy and lossless encoding. This technology was acquired in its original
form from Los Alamos National Laboratories (LANL), where it was developed
under the aegis of the U.S. government for storing fingerprints for the FBI.
Now is is developed and distributed by the LizardTech, Inc.<p>

This driver supports reading of MrSID image files using LizardTech's decoding
software development kit (DSDK). <b>This DSDK is not free software, you should
contact LizardTech to obtain it (see link at end of this page).</b> If you are
using GCC, please, ensure that you are using the same compiler as was used
for DSDK compilation. It is C++ library, so you may get incompatibilities
in C++ name mangling between different GCC versions (2.95.x and 3.x).<p>

<h2>Metadata</h2>

MrSID metadata transparently translated into GDAL metadata strings. Note,
that files in MrSID format contain a set of standard metadata tags such as:
IMAGE::WIDTH (contains the width of the image), IMAGE::HEIGHT (contains the
height of the image), IMAGE::XY_ORIGIN (contains the x and y coordinates
of the origin), IMAGE::INPUT_NAME (contains the name or names of the files
used to create the MrSID image) etc.<p>
