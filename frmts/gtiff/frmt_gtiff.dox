<title>GTiff -- GeoTIFF File Format</title>

Most forms of TIFF and GeoTIFF files are supported by GDAL for reading, and
somewhat less varieties can be written.

Currently band types of Byte, UInt16, Int16, and Float32 are supported for
reading.  Paletted images will return palette information associated with
the band.  The compression formats listed below should be supported for
reading as well. 

Most GeoTIFF projections should be supported, with the caveat that in order
to translate uncommon Projected, and Geographic coordinate systems into 
OGC WKT it is necessary to have the EPSG .csv files avalable.  They must
be found at the location pointed to by the GEOTIFF_CSV environment variable.

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

GeoTIFF files can be created with image band types of Byte, UInt16, Int16, 
and Float32.  Other types are not currently supported for creation.  Created
files may have any number of bands.  Files with exactly 3 bands will be
given a photometric interpretation of RGB, while all other combinations will
have a photometric interpretation of Min Is White.  It is not currently 
possible to create TIFF files with pseudo-color tables with GDAL.<p>

Creation Options:<p>

<ul>

<li> <b>TILED=YES</b>: By default stripped TIFF files are created.  This
option can be used to force creation of tiled TIFF files.<p>

<li> <b>BLOCKXSIZE=n</b>: Sets tile width, defaults to 256.<p>

<li> <b>BLOCKYSIZE=n</b>: Set tile or strip height.  Tile height defaults to
256, strip height defaults to a value such that one strip is 8K or less. <p>

<li> <b>COMPRESS=[JPEG/LZW/PACKBITS/DEFLATE/NONE]</b>: Set the compression
to use.  JPEG should only be used with Byte data.  LZW is normally 
unavailable.  None is the default.<p>

</ul>

GeoTIFF supports internal creation of overviews (with gdaladdo for instance).
