<h1>GIF -- Grahpics Interchange Format</h1>

GDAL supports reading and writing of normal, and interlaced GIF files.  Gif
files always appear as having one colormapped eight bit band. GIF files have
no support for georeferencing.<p>

At this time, transparency within GIF is not supported for reading
or writing.<p>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

GIF files can only be created as 1 8bit band using the "CreateCopy" mechanism.
If written from a file that is not colormapped, a default greyscale colormap
is generated.<p>

Interlaced (progressive) GIF files can be generated by supplying the 
<b>INTERLACING=ON</b> option on creation. <p>

By default GDAL does not support the creation of LZW compressed GIF files
due to the usual LZW patent issues; however, it is possible to build GDAL
from source with LZW compression support if the LZW supporting version of
<b>giflib</b> is installed.<p>

GDAL's GIF support is implemented based on source from the libungif library
written by Gershon Elbor, Eric Raymond and Toshio Kuratomi.  It was written
with the financial support of the <a href="http://www.dmsolutions.ca/">DM
Solutions Group</a>, and <a href="http://www.ciet.org/">CIET 
International</a>.<p>
