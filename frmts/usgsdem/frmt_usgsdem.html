<h1>USGSDEM -- USGS ASCII DEM (and CDED)</h1>

GDAL includes support for reading USGS ASCII DEM files.  This is the
traditional format used by USGS before being replaced by SDTS, and is the
format used for CDED DEM data products from the Canada.  Most popular
variations on USGS DEM files should be supported, including correct
recognition of coordinate system, and georerenced positioning.<p>

The 7.5 minute (UTM grid) USGS DEM files will generally have regions of
missing data around the edges, and these are properly marked with
a nodata value.  Elevation values in USGS DEM files may be in meters or
feet, and this will be indicated by the return value of 
GDALRasterBand::GetUnitType() (either "m" or "ft").<p>

Note that USGS DEM files are represented as one big tile.  This may cause
cache thrashing problems if the GDAL tile cache size is small.  It will also
result in a substantial delay when the first pixel is read as the whole file
will be ingested. <p>

Some of the code for implementing usgsdemdataset.cpp was derived from 
VTP code by Ben Discoe.  See the <a href="http://www.vterrain.org/">Virtual
Terrain</a> project for more information on VTP.<p>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

GDAL supports export of geographic (but not UTM) USGS DEM and CDED data
files, including the ability to generate CDED 2.0 50K products to Canadian
federal govenment specifications. 

Input data must already be sampled in a geographic coordinate system.  By 
default the entire area of the input file will be output, but for CDED50K
products the output file will be sampled at the production specified resolution
and on product tile boundaries. 

Creation Options:<p>

<ul>

<li> <b>PRODUCT=CDED50K</b>: When selected, the output file will be forced to 
adhere to CDED 50K product specifications.  The output will always be 1201x1201
and generally a 15 minute by 15 minute tile (though wider in longitude in
far north areas). <p>

<li> <b>TOPLEFT=long,lat</b>: For CDED50K products, this is used to 
specify the top left corner of the tile to be generated.  It should be 
on a 15 minute boundary and can be given in decimal degrees or degrees and 
minutes (eg. TOPLEFT=117d15w,52d30n). <P>

<li> <b>TEMPLATE=filename</b>: For any output file, a template file can be
specified.  A number of fields (including the Data Producer) will be copied
from the template file if provided, and are otherwise left blank. 

</ul>

Example:

The following would generate a single CDED50K tile, extracting from the 
larger DEM coverage yk_3arcsec for a tile with the top left corner -117w,60n.
The file yk_template.dem is used to set some product fields including the
Producer of Data, Process Code and Origin Code fields. 

<pre>
gdal_translate -of USGSDEM -co PRODUCT=CDED50K -co TEMPLATE=yk_template.dem \
               -co TOPLEFT=-117w,60n yk_3arcsec 031a01_e.dem
</pre>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/sdts/usgsdemdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

The USGS DEM reading code in GDAL was derived from the importer in the
<a href="http://www.vterrain.org/">VTP</a> software.  The export capability
was developed with the financial support of the Yukon Department of  
Environment.<p>
