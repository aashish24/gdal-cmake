<h1>Various Support GDAL Raster Formats</h1>


<h2><a name="AAIGrid">AAIGrid -- Arc/Info ASCII Grid</a></h2>

Supported for read and write access, including reading of an affine
georeferencing transform and some projections.  
This format is the ASCII interchange format for Arc/Info Grid, 
and takes the form of an ASCII file, plus sometimes an associated .prj file.
It is normally produced with the Arc/Info ASCIIGRID command.<p>

The projections support (read if a *.prj file is available) is quite
limited.  Additional sample .prj files may be sent to the maintainer,
<a href="mailto:warmerdam@pobox.com">warmerdam@pobox.com</a>.<p>

The NODATA value for the grid read is also preserved when available.
Grids are treated as signed 16bit integer unless the first scanline contains
decimal values in which case the image is treated as 32bit floating point.
<p>

The <a href="#AIG">AIG</a> <a href="#GIO">GIO</a> drivers are also available
for Arc/Info Binary Grid format.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/aaigrid/aaigriddataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="AIG">AIG -- Arc/Info Binary Grid</a></h2>

Supported for read access, including reading of an affine georeferencing 
transform and some projections.  
This format is the internal binary format for Arc/Info Grid, 
and takes the form of a coverage level directory in an Arc/Info database. 
To open the coverage select the coverage directory, or an .adf file (such as
hdr.adf) from within it.<p>

This driver is implemented based on a reverse engineering of the format.  See
the <a href="http://gdal.velocet.ca/projects/aigrid/index.html">format 
description</a> for more details.<p>

The projections support (read if a prj.adf file is available) is quite
limited.  Additional sample prj.adf files may be sent to the maintainer,
<a href="mailto:warmerdam@pobox.com">warmerdam@pobox.com</a>.<p>

Note that another driver (<a href="#GIO">GIO</a>) is available for Windows 
platforms with ArcView installed.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/aigrid/aigdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="BSB">BSB -- Maptech/NOAA BSB Nautical Chart Format</a></h2>

Supported for read access, including reading the colour table and the
reference points (as GCPs).  Note that the .BSB files cannot be selected
directly.  Instead select the .KAP files. <p>

This driver should also support GEO/NOS format as supplied by Softchart.
These files normally have the extension .nos with associated .geo files
containing georeferencing ... the .geo files are currently ignored. <P>

This driver is based on work by Mike Higgins.  See the frmts/bsb/bsb_read.c
files for details on patents affecting BSB format.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/bsb/bsbdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="CEOS">CEOS -- CEOS Image</a></h2>

This is a simple, read-only reader for ceos image files.  To use, select
the main imagery file.  This driver reads only the image data, and does
not capture any metadata, or georeferencing.<p>

This driver is known to work with CEOS data produced by Spot Image, but
will have problems with many other data sources.  In particular, it will
only work with eight bit unsigned data.<p>

See the separate <a href="#SAR_CEOS">SAR_CEOS</a> driver for access to 
SAR CEOS data products.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/ceos/ceosdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="DOQ1">DOQ1 -- First Generation USGS DOQ</a></h2>

Support for read access, including reading of an affine georeferencing 
transform, and capture of the projection string.   This format is the old,
unlabelled DOQ (Digital Ortho Quad) format from the USGS.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/doq1dataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="DOQ2">DOQ2 -- New Labelled USGS DOQ</a></h2>

Support for read access, including reading of an affine georeferencing 
transform, capture of the projection string and reading of other auxilary
fields as metadata.   This format is the new,
labelled DOQ (Digital Ortho Quad) format from the USGS.<p>

This driver was implemented by Derrick J Brashear.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/doq2dataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

See Also: <a href="http://rockyweb.cr.usgs.gov/nmpstds/doqstds.html">
USGS DOQ Standards</a><p>

<h2><a name="DTED">DTED -- Military Elevation Data</a></h2>

GDAL supports DTED Levels 1, and 2 elevation data for read access.  Elevation
data is returned as 16 bit signed integer.  Appropriate projection (always
WGS84) and georeferencing information is also returned.   No other metadata 
is captured.
<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/dted/dteddataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="EFF">EFF -- Eosat Fast Format</a></h2>

Support for read access to EOSAT Fast Format data is available in GDAL.  
EOSAT datasets normally consist of one or more raster data files (eg. 
BAND1.DAT, BAND2.DAT, ...) and a header file which must be called HEADER.DAT.
To open the dataset select the HEADER.DAT file.<p>

Currently only the raster data is accessed.  Georeferencing, and other meta
data is ignored.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/effdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="EHdr">EHdr -- ESRI .hdr Labelled</h2>

GDAL supports the ESRI .hdr labelling format for reading raw raster data
(often referred to as ESRI BIL format) for read-only access.  Eight, sixteen
and thirty-two bit integer raster data types are supported as well as reading
of the affine georeferencing transform.  Reading of projection definitions
is not supported.  Unrecognised options in the .hdr file are ignored.  To 
open a dataset select the file with the image file (often with the extension
.bil).<p>

This driver may be sufficient to read GTopo 30 data, and Geospot products.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/ehdrdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="ENVI">ENVI - ENVI .hdr Labelled Raster</h2>

GDAL supports some variations of raw raster files with associated ENVI
style .hdr files describing the format.  To select an existing ENVI raster
file select the binary file containing the data (as opposed to the .hdr 
file), and GDAL will find the .hdr file by replacing the dataset extension
with .hdr.<p>

GDAL should support reading bil, bip and bsq interleaved formats, and
the 8bit, 16bit signed, 16bit unsigned, and 32bit floating point pixel types.
There is limited support for recognising map_info keywords with the 
coordinate system and georeferencing.  In particular, UTM and State Plane 
should work.<p>

At this time there is no support for creating ENVI labelled dataset.<p>


NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/envidataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="Envisat">Envisat -- Envisat Image Product</h2>

GDAL supports the Envisat product format for read access.  All sample
types are supported.  Files with two matching measurement datasets (MDS)
are represented as having two bands.<p>

The control points of the GEOLOCATION GRID ADS dataset are read if available,
generally giving a good coverage of the dataset.  The GCPs are in WGS84.<p>

Virtually all key/value pairs from the MPH and SPH (primary and secondary
headers) are copied through as dataset level metadata. <p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/envisat/envisatdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="FITS">FITS -- Flexible Image Transport System</h2>

<p>FITS is a format used mainly by astronomers, but it is a relatively
simple format that supports arbitrary image types and multi-spectral
images, and so has found its way into GDAL. FITS support is
implemented in terms of the standard <a
href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html">CFITSIO
library</a>, which you must have on your system in order for FITS
support to be enabled. Both reading and writing of FITS files is
supported. At the current time, no support for a georeferencing system
is implemented, but WCS (World Coordinate System) support is possible
in the future.

<p>Non-standard header keywords that are present in the FITS file will
be copied to the dataset's metadata when the file is opened, for
access via GDAL methods. Similarly, non-standard header keywords that
the user defines in the dataset's metadata will be written to the FITS
file when the GDAL handle is closed.

<p>FITS files that contain the header keywords BSCALE and BZERO are
handled specially. Such files appear to GDAL to contain float data,
regardless of the actual type of the data in the file. Data read
from or written to the file is automatically scaled according to the
formula:

<blockquote>
external_value = BZERO + BSCALE * stored_value
</blockquote>

<p>The BSCALE and BZERO header keywords can only be set during file
creation, using the creation options listed below. The type specified
for the Create() method should indicate the required underlying data
type of the file (typically, byte). As far as GDAL is concerned the
file will look like a float file. This special behavior can be
disabled using the NOSCALE creation option. With this option in place,
in addition to the BSCALE/BZERO options, then the BSCALE and BZERO
header keywords will be set, but the file will behave in every other
way like a normal file. This is useful when you want to write raw
values to the file, but also want to set BSCALE and BZERO.

<p>Creation Options:

<ul>

  <li> <b>BSCALE=nnn</b>: Set the FITS BSCALE header to the specified
value, and enable automatic re-scaling of data on read/write. If
BSCALE is specified, then BZERO must also be specified.

  <li> <b>BZERO=nnn</b>: Set the FITS BZERO header to the specified
value, and enable automatic re-scaling of data on read/write. If BZERO
is specified then BSCALE must also be specified.

  <li> <b>NOSCALE=yes</b>: Only has an effect if BSCALE/BZERO are
specified, in which case it disables the re-scaling normally induced
by those options.

</ul>

<p>NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/fits/fitsdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="GIO">GIO -- Arc/Info Binary Grid</a></h2>

This is a second implementation for reading, and writing Arc/Info grids, and
only works on Windows platforms with ArcView installed.  It uses the 
AVGRIDIO.DLL installed with ArcView to implement full access.<p>

This driver supports georeferencing bounds, but no projection definition. 
New coverages can be created with a code of GIO. <p>

Also see the <a href="#AIG">AIG</a> read-only driver available on all 
platforms.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/aigrid/giodataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="GXF">GXF -- Grid eXchange File</a></h2>

This is a raster exchange format propagated by Geosoft, and made a standard
in the gravity/magnetics field.  The format is supported for read, and write
and includes support for georeferencing information, and projections. <p>

Details on the supporting code, and format can be found on the
<a href="http://gdal.velocet.ca/projects/gxf/index.html">GXF-3</a> page.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/gxf/gxfdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="JDEM">JDEM -- Japanese DEM (.mem)</a></h2>

GDAL includes read support for Japanese DEM files, normally having the
extension .mem. 

These files are represented as having one 32bit floating band with elevation
data.  The georeferencing of the files is returned as well as the coordinate
system (always lat/long on the Tokyo datum). 

There is no update or creation support for this format. 

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/jdem/jdemdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="MFF">MFF -- Atlantis MFF Raster</a></h2>

GDAL includes read, update, and creation support for Atlantis Scientific's
MFF raster format.  MFF dataset consist of a header file (typically with
the extension .hdr) and a set of data files with extensions like .x00, .b00
and so on.   To open a dataset select the .hdr file.<p>

Reading lat/long GCPs (TOP_LEFT_CORNER, ...) is supported but there is no
support for reading affine georeferencing or projection information.<p>

Unrecognised keywords from the .hdr file are preserved as metadata. <p>

All data types with GDAL equivelents are supported, including 8, 16, 32 and
64 bit data precisions in integer, real and complex data types.  In addition
tile organized files (as produced by the Atlantis SAR Processor - APP) are
supported for reading. <p>

On creation (with a format code of MFF) a simple, ungeoreferenced raster
file is created.<p>

MFF files are not normally portable between systems with different byte orders.
However GDAL honours the new BYTE_ORDER keyword which can take a value of
LSB (Integer -- little endian), and MSB (Motorola -- big endian).  This may
be manually added to the .hdr file if required.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/mffdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="MFF2">MFF2 -- Atlantis MFF2 Image</a></h2>

GDAL supports MFF2 Image raster file format for read, update, and creation.
This format is primarily used internally to the Atlantis Scientific InSAR
processing system.<p>

To select an MFF2 dataset select the directory containing the <tt>attrib</tt>, 
and <tt>image_data</tt> files for the dataset.<p>

Currently only the UTM projection is supported (georef.projection.name = utm),
with the affine transform computed from the lat/long control points.   In
any event, if GCPs are available in a georef file, they are returned with 
the dataset.<p>

Newly created files (with a type of <tt>MFF2</tt>) are always just raw rasters
with no georeferencing information.  For read, and creation all data types
(real, integer and complex in bit depths of 8, 16, 32) should be supported. <p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/hkvdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="PAux">PAux -- PCI .aux Labelled Raw Format</a></h2>

GDAL includes a partial implementation of the PCI .aux labelled raw raster 
file for read, write and creation.  To open a PCI labelled file, select the
raw data file itself.  The .aux file (which must have a common base name) will
be checked for automatically. <p>

The format type for creating new files is <tt>PAux</tt>.  All PCI data types
(8U, 16U, 16S, and 32R) are supported.  Currently georeferencing, projections, 
and other metadata is ignored.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/pauxdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

Description</a><p>

<h2><a name="PNG">PNG -- Portable Network Graphics</a></h2>

GDAL includes support for reading, and creating .png files.  Greyscale, 
pseudo-colored, Paletted, RGB and RGBA PNG files are supported as well as 
precisions of eight and sixteen bits per sample.<p>

PNG files are linearly compressed, so random reading of large PNG files can
be very inefficient (resulting in many restarts of decompression from the
start of the file).<p>

Text chunks are translated into metadata, typically with multiple lines per
item.  World files with the extensions of .wld, .tfw or .tifw will be read.  
Single transparency values in greyscale files will be recognised as a nodata
value in GDAL.  Transparent index in paletted images are preserved when the
color table is read. <p>

PNG files can be created with a type of PNG, using the CreateCopy() method, 
requiring a prototype to read from.  Writing includes support for the
various image types, and will preserve transparency/nodata values.  
Georeferencing .wld files are written if option WORLFFILE setted.  All
pixel types other than 16bit unsigned will be written as eight bit.<p>

Creation Options:<p>

<ul>

<li> <b>WORLDFILE=YES</b>: Force the generation of an associated ESRI world
file (.wld).<p>
</ul>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/png/pngdataset.cpp</tt>.<p> 

PNG support is implemented based on the libpng reference library.  
More information is available at <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png">
http://www.libpng.org/pub/png</a>.<p>

<h2><a name="PNM">PNM -- Netpbm (.pgm, .ppm)</a></h2>

GDAL includes support for reading, and creating .pgm (greyscale), and
.ppm (RGB color) files compatible with the Netpbm tools.  Only the binary
(raw) formats are supported.<p>

Netpbm files can be created with a type of PNM.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/raw/pnmdataset.cpp</tt>. 

<h2><a name="SAR_CEOS">SAR_CEOS -- CEOS SAR Image</a></h2>

This is a read-only reader for CEOS SAR image files.  To use, select
the main imagery file.<p>

This driver works with most Radarsat and ERS data
products, including simple look complex products; however, it is unlikely
to work for non-Radar CEOS products.  The simplier <a href="#CEOS">CEOS</a>
driver is often appropriate for these.<p>

This driver will attempt to read 15 lat/long GCPS by sampling the per-scanline
CEOS superstructure information.  It also captures various pieces of metadata
from various header files, including:<p>

<pre>
  CEOS_LOGICAL_VOLUME_ID=EERS-1-SAR-MLD  
  CEOS_PROCESSING_FACILITY=APP         
  CEOS_PROCESSING_AGENCY=CCRS    
  CEOS_PROCESSING_COUNTRY=CANADA      
  CEOS_SOFTWARE_ID=APP 1.62    
  CEOS_ACQUISITION_TIME=19911029162818919               
  CEOS_SENSOR_CLOCK_ANGLE=  90.000
  CEOS_ELLIPSOID=IUGG_75         
  CEOS_SEMI_MAJOR=    6378.1400000
  CEOS_SEMI_MINOR=    6356.7550000
</pre>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/ceos2/sar_ceosdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="SDTS">SDTS -- USGS SDTS DEM</a></h2>

GDAL includes support for reading USGS SDTS formatted DEMs.  USGS DEMs are
always returned with a data type of signed sixteen bit integer.  Projection
and georeferencing information is also returned.<p>

SDTS datasets consist of a number of files.  Each DEM should have one file
with a name like XXXCATD.DDF.  This should be selected to open
the dataset.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/sdts/sdtsdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="USGSDEM">USGSDEM -- USGS ASCII DEM</a></h2>

GDAL includes support for reading USGS ASCII DEM files.  These are the
traditional format used by USGS before being replaced by SDTS.  Most popular
variations on USGS DEM files should be supported, including correct
recognition of coordinate system, and georerenced positioning.<p>

The 7.5 minute (UTM grid) USGS DEM files will generally have regions of
missing data around the edges, and these are properly marked with
a nodata value.  Elevation values in USGS DEM files may be in meters or
feet, and this will be indicated by the return value of 
GDALRasterBand::GetUnitType() (either "m" or "ft").<p>

Note that USGS DEM files are represented as one big tile.  This may cause
cache thrashing problems if the GDAL tile cache size is small.  It will also
result in a substantial delay when the first pixel is read as the whole file
will be ingested. <p>

Some of the code for implementing usgsdemdataset.cpp was derived from 
VTP code by Ben Discoe.  See the <a href="http://www.vterrain.org/">Virtual
Terrain</a> project for more information on VTP.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/sdts/usgsdemdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>

<h2><a name="XPM">XPM - X11 Pixmap</a></h2>

GDAL includes support for reading and writing XPM (X11 Pixmap Format) 
image files.  These are colormapped one band images primarily used for 
simple graphics purposes in X11 applications.  It has been incorporated in
GDAL primarily to ease translation of GDAL images into a form useable with
the GTK toolkit.<p>

The XPM support does not support georeferecing (not available from XPM files)
nor does it support XPM files with more than one character per pixel.  New
XPM files must be colormapped or greyscale, and colortables will be reduced
to about 70 colors automatically.<p>

NOTE: Implemented as <tt>gdal/frmts/xpm/xpmdataset.cpp</tt>.<p>
