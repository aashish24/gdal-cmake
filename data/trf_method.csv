be expressed in terms of a geocentric (earth centred) cartesian coordinate system X, Y, Z \
with the Z axis corresponding with the Polar axis positive northwards, the X axis through \
the intersection of the Greenwich meridian and equator, and the Y axis through the \
intersection of the equator with longitude 90 degrees E. If the GCS's prime meridian is not \
Greewich, longitudes must first be converted to their Greenwich equivalent. If the earth's \
spheroidal semi major axis is a, semi minor axis  b, and inverse flattening 1/f,  then\
\
   XA=   (nu + hA) cos P cos L\
   YA=   (nu + hA) cos P sin L\
   ZA=  ((1 - e^2) nu + hA) sin P\
\
where nu is the prime vertical radius of curvature at latitude P and is equal to \
   nu = a /(1 - e^2*sin^2(P))^0.5,\
   P and L are respectively the latitude and longitude (related to Greenwich) of the \
point \
   h is height above the ellipsoid, (topographic height plus geoidal height), and\
   e is the eccentricity of the ellipsoid where e^2 = (a^2 -b^2)/a^2 = 2f -f^2\
                                                                                                                                                   Cartesian coordinates in geocentric coordinate system  B may be used \
to derive geographical coordinates in terms of geographic coordinate system B by:\
   P   =  arctan (ZB + e^2* nu*sin P) / (XB^2 + YB^2)^0.5 by iteration\
   L   = arctan YB/XB\
   hB  =  XB sec L sec P  - nu\
\
where LB is relative to Greenwich. If the geographic system has a non Greenwich prime \
meridian, the Greenwich value of the local prime meridian should be applied to longitude.\
\
(Note that h is the height above the ellipsoid. This is the height value which is \
delivered by Transit and GPS satellite observations but is not the topographic \
height value which is normally used for national mapping and levelling operations. \
The topographic height is usually the height above mean sea level or an alternative \
level reference for the country. If one starts with a topographic height,  it will be \
necessary to convert it to an ellipsoid height before using the above transformation \
formulas. h = N + H, where N is the geoid height above the ellipsoid at the point \
and is sometimes negative, and H is the height of the point above the geoid. The \
height above the geoid is often taken to be that above mean sea level, perhaps with \
a constant correction applied. Geoid heights of points above the nationally used \
ellipsoid may not be readily available. For the WGS84 ellipsoid the value of N, \
representing the height of the geoid relative to the ellipsoid, can vary between \
values of -100m in the Sri Lanka area to +60m in the North Atlantic.)","Consider a North Sea point with coordinates derived by GPS satellite in the WGS84 geographical coordinate system with coordinates of:\

           longitude 02 deg 07 min 46.38 sec E, \
    and ellipsoidal height 73.0m, \
\
whose coordinates are required in terms of the ED50 geographical coordinate system which takes the International 1924 ellipsoid. The three parameter datum shift from WGS84 to ED50 for this North Sea area is given as dX = +84.87m, dY = +96.49m, dZ = +116.95m. \

   ZB = 5124 421.30m\

    and ellipsoidal height 28.02 m, \

Abridged versions of these formulas, which are quite satisfactory for three parameter transformations, are as follows:\
\
Dlat \" = [(-dX*sin(lat)*cos(lon)) - (dY*sin(lat)*sin(lon)) + (dZ*cos(lat)) + (((a*Df) + (f*Da))*sin(2*lat))] / (rho * sin(1\"))\

[geographical to geocentric >> geocentric to geocentric >> geocentric to geographic]\
\
The middle part of the concatenated transformation, from geocentric to geocentric, is usually described as a simplified 7-parameter Helmert transformation, expressed in matrix form with 7 parameters, in what is known as the \"Bursa-Wolf\" formula:\
\
   (X’)             (  1       -Rz    +Ry)      (X)     (dX)\
   (Y’)  =  M * ( +Rz     1      -Rx)  *  (Y)  + (dY)\
   (Z’)              ( -Ry   +Rx       1 )      (Z)      (dZ)\
\
The parameters are commonly referred to defining the datum transformation \"from Datum 'A' to Datum 'B'\", whereby (X, Y, Z) are the geocentric coordinates of the point on Datum ‘A’ and (X’, Y’, Z’) are the geocentric coordinates of the point on Datum ‘B’.  However, that does not define the parameters uniquely; neither is the definition of the parameters implied in the formula, as is often believed.  However, the following definition, which is consistent witth the \"Position Vector Transformation\" convention, is common E&P survey practice: \
\
(dX, dY, dZ)   :Translation vector, to be added to the point's position vector in coordinate system 'A' in order to transform from system 'A' to system 'B'; also: the coordinates of the origin of system 'A' in the 'B' frame.\
\
(Rx, Ry, Rz)   :Rotations to be applied to the point's vector.  The sign convention is such that a positive rotation about an axis is defined as a clockwise rotation of the position vector when viewed from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system in the positive direction of that axis. E.g. a positive rotation about the Z-axis only from system 'A' to system 'B' will result in a larger longitude value for the point in system 'B'.\
\
M                  :	The scale correction to be made to the position vector in coordinate system 'A' in order to obtain the correct scale of coordinate system 'B'. M = (1+S*10 6), whereby S is the scale correction expressed in parts per million.  \

\
Although being common practice in particularly the European E&P industry Position Vector Transformation sign convention is not universally accepted.  A variation on this formula is also used, particularly in the USA E&P industry.  That formula is based on the same definition of translation and scale parameters, but a different definition of the rotation parameters.  The associated convention is known as the \"Coordinate Frame Rotation\" convention. \
The formula is:\
\
   (X’)             (  1      +Rz      -Ry)    (X)      (dX)\
   (Y’)  =  M * ( -Rz      1      +Rx) * (Y)  +  (dY)\
   (Z’)              ( +Ry   -Rx        1 )    (Z)       (dZ)\
\
and the parameters are defined as:\
\
(dX, dY, dZ)   : Translation vector, to be added to the point's position vector in coordinate system 'A' in order to transform from system 'A' to system 'B'; also: the coordinates of the origin of system 'A' in the 'B' frame.\
\
(Rx, Ry, Rz)   : Rotations to be applied to the coordinate frame.  The sign convention is such that a positive rotation of the frame about an axis is defined as a clockwise rotation of the coordinate frame when viewed from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system in the positive direction of that axis, that is a positive rotation about the Z-axis only from system 'A' to system 'B' will result in a smaller longitude value for the point in system 'B'.\
\
M                  : The scale factor to be applied to the position vector in coordinate system 'A' in order to obtain the correct scale of coordinate system 'B'. M = (1+S*10 6), whereby S is the scale correction expressed in parts per million.\
\
In the absence of rotations the two formulas are identical; the difference is solely in the rotations. The name of the second method reflects this.\
\
Note that the same rotation that is defined as positive in the first method is consequently negative in the second and vice versa.  It is therefore crucial that the convention underlying the definition of the rotation parameters is clearly understood and is communicated when exchanging datum transformation parameters, so that the parameters may be associated with the correct coordinate transformation method (algorithm).","The same example as for the Position Vector Transformation can be calculated, however the following transformation parameters have to be applied to achieve the same input and output in terms of coordinate values:\

The polynomial coefficients derived can be used to convert from Madrid 1870 to ED50.  Three pairs of expressions have been derived: each pair is used to calculate the shift in latitude and longitude respectively for (i) a mean for all Spain, (ii) a better fit for the north of Spain, (iii) a better fit for the south of Spain.\

\
For areas south of the equator the value of latitude lat will be negative and the formulas above, to compute the E and N,  will automatically result in the correct values. Note that the false northings of the origin, if the equator, will need to be large to avoid negative northings and for the UTM projection is in fact 10,000,000m. Alternatively, as in the case of Argentina's Transverse Mercator (Gauss-Kruger) zones, the origin is at the south pole with a northings of zero. However each zone central meridian takes a false easting of 500000m prefixed by an identifying zone number. This ensures that instead of points in \
different zones having the same eastings, every point in the country, irrespective of its projection zone, will have a unique set of projected system coordinates. Strict application of the above formulas, with south latitudes negative, will result in the derivation of the correct Eastings and Northings. \

Similarly, in applying the reverse formulas to determine a latitude south of the equator, a negative sign for lat results from a negative lat1 which in turn results from a negative M1.","For Projected Coordinate System OSGB 1936 / British National Grid\

9809,Oblique Stereographic,,,Latitude of natural origin,Longitude of natural origin,,,Scale factor at natural origin,False easting,False northing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The coordinate transformation from geographical to projected coordinates is executed via the distance and azimuth of the point from the centre point or origin. For a sphere the formulas are relatively simple. For the ellipsoid the parameters defining the conformal sphere at the tangent point as origin are first derived. The conformal latitudes and longitudes are substituted for the geodetic  latitudes and longitudes of the spherical formulas for the origin and the point.\
\
Oblique and Equatorial Stereographic Formula\
\
Given the geodetic origin of the projection at the tangent point (lat0, lon0), the parameters defining the conformal sphere are:\
\
R= sqrt( rho0 * nu0)\
n=  sqrt{1+[(e2*cos^4(lat0))/(1-e2)}\
c=  [(n+sin(lat0)) (1-sin(chi0))]/[(n-sin(lat0)) (1+sin(chi0))]\
\
where:	sin(chi0) = (w1-1)/(w1+1)\
w1 = (S1.(S2)^e)^n\
S1 = (1+sin(lat0))/(1-sin(lat0))\
S2 = (1-e sin(lat0))/(1+e sin(lat0))\
\
The conformal latitude and longitude (chi0,lambda0) of the origin are then computed from :\
\
chi0 = asin[(w2-1)/(w2+1)]\
\
where S1 and S2 are as above and  w2 = c (S1(S2)^e)^n\
 \
lambda0  = lon0\
\
For any point with geodetic coordinates (lat, lon) the equivalent conformal latitude and longitude (chi, lambda) are computed from \
lambda = n(lon-lambda0) + lambda0\
chi = asin[(w-1)/(w+1)]\
\
where w = c (Ss (Sb)^e)^n\
Sa = (1+sin(lat))/(1-sin(lat))\
Sb = (1-e.sin(lat))/(1+e.sin(lat))\
 \
Then B = [1+sin(chi) sin(chi0) + cos(chi) cos(chi0) cos(lambda-lambda0)]\
\
N = FN + 2 R k0 [sin(chi) cos(chi0) - cos(chi) sin(chi0) cos(lambda-lambda0)] / B\
\
E = FE + 2 R k0 cos(chi) sin(lambda-lambda0) / B\
\
\
The reverse formulae to compute the geodetic coordinates from the grid coordinates involves computing the conformal values, then the isometric latitude and finally the geodetic values.\
\
The parameters of the conformal sphere and conformal latitude and longitude at the origin are computed as above. Then for any point with Stereographic grid coordinates (E,N) :\
\
chi = chi0 + 2 atan[{(N-FN)-(E-FE) tan (j/2)} / (2 R k0)]\
\
lambda = j + 2 i + lambda0\
\
where g = 2 R k0 tan(pi/4 - chi0/2)\
h = 4 R k0 tan(chi0) + g\
i = atan[(E-FE) / {h+(N-FN)}]\
j = atan[(E-FE) / (g-(N-FN)] - i\
\
Geodetic longitude lon = (lambda-lambda0 ) / n +  lambda0\
\
Isometric latitude psi = 0.5 ln [(1+ sin(chi)) / { c (1-  sin(chi))}] / n\
\
First approximation lat1 = 2 atan(e^psi)  - pi/2  where e=base of natural logarithms.\
\
psii = isometric latitude at lati\
\
where psii= ln[{tan(lati/2 + pi/4}  {(1-e sin(lati))/(1+e sin(lati))}^(e/2)]\
 \
Then iterate lat(i+1) = lati - ( psii - psi ) cos(lati) (1 -e^2 sin^2(lati)) / (1 - e^2)\
\
until the change in lat is sufficiently small.\
\
\
For Oblique Stereographic projections centred on points in the southern hemisphere,  the signs of E, N, lon0, lon,  must be reversed to be used in the equations and lat will be negative anyway as a southerly latitude.\
\
An alternative approach is given by Snyder, where, instead of defining a single conformal sphere at the origin point, the conformal latitude at each point on the ellipsoid is computed. The conformal longitude is then always equivalent to the geodetic longitude. This approach is a valid alternative to the above, but gives slightly different results away from the origin point.  It is therefore considered to be a different projection method.","For Projected Coordinate System RD / Netherlands New\

\
LonParis (grads) = 7.83445 + [(E - 270) * 0.012185], where E is in kilometres.\
\
The reverse formulae are:\
\
E (km) = 270 + [(LonParis - 7.83445) / 0.012185] where LonParis is in grads.\
\
N (km) = 360 + [(Lat - 36.5964) / B] \
where Lat is in grads and B = 0.010015  if  lat>36.5964, else B = 0.01002.\
\
Degrees from Greenwich.\
\
Modern practice in Tunisia is to quote latitude and longitude in degrees with longitudes referenced to the Greenwich meridian.  The formulae required in addition to the above are:\
\
Lat (degrees) =  (Latg * 0.9) where Latg is in grads.\
LonGreenwich (degrees) = [(LonParis + 2.5969213) * 0.9] where LonParis is in grads.\
\
\
Lat (grads) =  (Latd / 0.9) where Latd is in decimal degrees.\
LonParis (grads) = [(LonGreenwich / 0.9) - 2.5969213)] where LonGreenwich is in decimal degrees.","For grid location 302598,\
Latitude = 36.5964 + [(598 - 360) * A].  As N > 360, A = 0.010015.\
Latitude = 38.97997 grads = 35.08197 degrees.\
\
Longitude  = 7.83445 + [(E - 270) * 0.012185, where E = 302.\
