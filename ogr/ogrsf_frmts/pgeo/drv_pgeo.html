<h1>ESRI Personal GeoDatabase</h1>

OGR optionally supports reading ESRI Personal GeoDatabase .mdb files via ODBC.
Personal GeoDatabase is a Microsoft Access database with a set of tables
defined by ESRI for holding geodatabase metadata, and with geometry for
features held in a BLOB column in a custom format (essentially Shapefile
geometry fragments).  This drivers accesses the personal geodatabase via
ODBC but does not depend on any ESRI middleware.  <p>

ODBC datasources are accessed using a datasource name of the form
<b>PGEO:<i>dsn</i></b>.  

The <b><i>dsn</i></b> is the ODBC Data Source Name.  You will need to use
the ODBC Adminstration tool to assign a DSN for each .mdb file you wish
to access from OGR.<p>

OGR treats all feature tables as layers.  Most geometry types should be
supported, including 3D data.  Measures information will be discarded. 
Coordinate system information should be properly associated with layers. <p>
