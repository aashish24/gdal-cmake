<h1>KML - Keyhole Markup Language</h1>

<p>OGR has limited support for KML writing and no support
for reading KML. OGR generates KML 2.0. 
The KML driver has no coordinate system support at this time.<p>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>
<p>KML is mix of formatting and feature data. When writing KML, attributes are added to
the output with the following HTML structure:
<pre>&lt;b>Attribute name&lt;/b>: Attribute content</pre>
</p>
<p>On export all layers are written to a single KML file wrapped in a single
folder element. In the future support could be added for layers ending up in
separate folder elements.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
The ogr2ogr utility can be used to dump the results of a PostGIS query to
KML:

<pre>
ogr2ogr -f KML output.kml PG:'host=myserver dbname=warmerda' -sql "SELECT pop_1994 from canada where province_name = 'Alberta'"
</pre>
</p>
