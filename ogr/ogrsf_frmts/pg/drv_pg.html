<h1>PostgreSQL</h1>

This is an experimental driver for prototyping options for using PostgreSQL
(and PostgreSQL extended with 
<a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS</a>)
as a vector database.<p>

When opening a database, it's name should be specified in the form
"PG:dbname=<databasename>".  We use
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/programmer/libpq-chapter.htm#AEN3240">
PQconnectcb()</a> to make the connection, so any other options and defaults
that would apply to it, apply to the name here.  The PG: prefix is used
to mark the name as a postgress connection string.<p>

Currently all regular user tables are assumed to be layers from an OGR
point of view, with the table names as the layer names.  Named views are
not currently support.<p>

Regular (non-spatial) tables can be accessed, and will return features with
attributes, but not geometry.  If the table has a "wkb_geometry" field, it will
be treated as a spatial table.  The type of the field is inspected to 
determine how to read it.  It can be a PostGIS <b>geometry</b> field, which
is assumed to come back in OGC WKT, or type BYTEA or OID in which case it
is used as a source of OGC WKB geometry.<p>

If there is an "ogc_fid" field, it will be used to set the feature id of
the features, and not treated as a regular field. <p>

Currently there is no support for coordinate systems in the PostgreSQL driver.
<p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<ul>

<li> The type recognition logic is currently quite impoverished.  Only 
the types "VARCHAR*", "INT*", and "FLOAT*" are recognised directly.  All
other types are treated as VARCHAR.<p>

<li> BYTEA fields in PostgreSQL version preceeding 7.1
don't support more than 8K in a record, so significant sized geometries
on a feature will trigger an errow about the INSERT command being to big
for the buffer.  Upgrade to 7.1.x!<P>

<li> The driver is not performance tuned.  All geometry is passed back
and forth in escaped BYTEA text form, there is no spatial indexing, etc.<p>

<li> Some features are not implemented properly.  For instance, spatial
filtering is broken.<p>

<li> Special field names, and other mechanisms are likely to change in the
near future.  This driver is only suitable to use for experimentation.<p>

<li> A sequence object called <tablename>_ogc_fid_seq is created for new
tables (layer), and must be dropped separately from the table when cleaning
up.<p>

<li> Sequential reading is done within a single transaction.  Any attempts
to write to a layer within a sequential read will likely result in a "BEGIN"
while already within a transaction type of error message.<p>

</ul>

<h2>Creation Issues</h2>

The PostgreSQL driver does not support creation of new datasets (a database
within PostgreSQL), but it does allow creation of new layers within an
existing database.<P>

As mentioned above the type system is impoverished, and many OGR types
are not appropriate mapped into PostgreSQL.<p>

Currently only sequential writing is supported.<p>

If the database has PostGIS types loaded (ie. the geometry type) newly
created layers will be created with the PostGIS Geometry type.  Otherwise
they will use OID.  

<h3>Dataset Creation Options</h3>

None<p>

<h3>Layer Creation Options</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<b>GEOM_TYPE</b>: The GEOM_TYPE layer creation option can be set to 
one of "Geometry", "BYTEA" or "OID" to force the type of geometry used for
a table. <p>
</ul>
