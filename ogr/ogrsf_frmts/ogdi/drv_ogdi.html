<h1>OGDI Vectors</h1>

OGDI vector support is optional in OGR, and is normally only configured if
OGDI is installed on the build system.  If available OGDI vectors are 
supported for read access for the following family types:
<ul>
  <li> Point
  <li> Line
  <li> Area
  <li> Text (Currently returned as points with the text in the "text" attribute)
</ul>
<p>

If an OGDI gltp url is opened directly the OGDI 3.1 capabilities for the
driver/server are queried to get a list of layers.  One OGR layer is created
for each OGDI family available for each layer in the datastore.  For drivers
such as VRF this can result in alot of layers.  Each of the layers has an
OGR name based on the OGDI name plus an underscore and the family name.  For
instance a layer might be called <b>watrcrsl@hydro(*)_line</b> if coming
out of the VRF driver. 

Alternatively to accessing all the layers in a datastore, it is possible to 
open a particular layer using a customized filename consisting
of the regular GLTP URL to
which you append the layer name and family type (separated by colons).  This
mechanism must be used to access layers of pre OGDI 3.1 drivers as before
OGDI 3.1 there was no regular way to discover available layers in OGDI.<p>

<PRE>
   gltp:[//&lt;hostname&gt;]/&lt;driver_name&gt;/&lt;dataset_name&gt;:&lt;layer_name&gt;:&lt;family&gt;
</PRE>

Where &lt;layer_name&gt; is the OGDI Layer name, and &lt;family&gt; is one of:
"line", "area", "point", or "text".<p>

OGDI coordinate system information is supported for most coordinate systems. 
A warning will be produced when a layer is opened if the coordinate
system cannot be translated.<p>

There is no update or creation support in the OGDI driver.<p>

Raster layers cannot be accessed with this driver but can be accessed
using the GDAL OGDI Raster driver.<p>
