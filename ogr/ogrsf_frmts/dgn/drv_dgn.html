<h1>Microstation DGN</h1>

Microstation DGN files from Microstation versions predating version 8.0
are supported for reading.  The entire file is represented as one layer
(named "elements").<p>

DGN files are considered to have no georeferencing information through OGR. 
Features will all have the following generic attributes:

<ul>
<li> Type: The integer type code as listed below in supported elements. 
<li> Level: The DGN level number (0-63). 
<li> GraphicGroup: The graphic group number.
<li> ColorIndex: The color index from the dgn palette.
<li> Weight: The drawing weight (thickness) for the element. 
<li> Style: The style value for the element. 
</ul>

DGN files do not contain spatial indexes; however, the DGN driver does take
advantage of the extents information at the beginning of each element to 
minimize processing of elements outside the current spatial filter window
when in effect.<p>

<h2>Supported Elements</h2>

The following element types are supported:<p>

<ul>
<li> Line (3): Line geometry. 
<li> Line String (4): Multi segment line geometry.
<li> Shape (6): Polygon geometry. 
<li> Curve (11): Approximated as a line geometry.
<li> B-Spline (21): Treated (inaccurately) as a line geometry.
<li> Arc (16): Approximated as a line geometry.
<li> Ellipse (15): Approximated as a line geometry.
<li> Text (17): Treated as a point geometry.
</ul>

Generally speaking any concept of complex objects, and cells as associated
components is lost.  Each component of a complex object or cell is treated
as a independent feature.<p>

<h2>Styling Information</h2>

Some drawing information about features can be extracted from the ColorIndex,
Weight and Style generic attributes; however, for all features an OGR
style string has been prepared with the values encoded in ready-to-use form
for applications supporting OGR style strings.<p>

The various kinds of linear geomtries will carry style information indicating
the color, thickness and line style (ie. dotted, solid, etc).<p>

Polygons (Shape elements) will carry styling information for the edge as well 
as a fill color if provided.  Fill patterns are not supported.<p>

Text elements will contain the text, angle, color and size information 
(expressed in ground units) in the style string.<p>
