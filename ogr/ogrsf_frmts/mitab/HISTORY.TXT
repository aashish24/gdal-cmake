MITAB Library - Revision History
================================


CHANGES - Current Version:
--------------------------


Version 1.1.0 - (2001-03-08)
----------------------------

- Modified mitab_imapinfofile.cpp so that variable width fields (nWidth=0)
  is translated to 254 characters, instead of 255 so it will actually be
  a legal field width in TAB.  (NFW)

- Make default and max char field with 254 chars in TABFile::AddFieldNative()

- Added a warning (TAB_WarningBoundsOverflow) on close of .MAP file if any 
  object was written with coordinates outside of the file's predefined 
  bounds.  (Causing an overflow of the +/-1e9 integer coord. range)

- Use MI defaults for Pen, Brush, Font, Symbol when creating new objects
  and when reading objects with no Pen, Brush, etc. set (used to just set
  everything to zero which was inconsistent with MI's behavior)
  New defaults are: PEN(1,2,0), BRUSH(2,16777215,16777215), 
  FONT("Arial",0,0,0), SYMBOL(35,0,12)

- Accept "TABLE TYPE LINKED" and handle them the same way as type NATIVE
  i.e. the link to the RDBMS is simply ignored.

- Added support for Swiss Oblique Mercator/Cylindrical. (NFW)

- Expand tabs (NFW)

- Added projection bounds lookup tables, automatically called by
  TABFile::SetProjInfo() (and SetSpatialRef() by the same way).
  TABFile::IsBoundsSet() can be used after setting projection to
  establish if some default bounds were found or not for the projection.

- Fixed IMapInfoFile::CreateFeature(), was leaking feature memory. (NFW)

- Fixed small memory leak in OGRTABDataSource::CreateLayer() (NFW)

- Support SpatialFilter inside IMapInfoFile::GetNextFeature().  
  TAB files should support spatial filter via their spatial index for 
  optimal performance.

- Avoid unnecessary cloning of features in IMapInfoFile::GetNextFeature() and
  IMapInfoFile::GetFeature().

- Added TABText::Get/SetTextLineEndPoint() and properly read/write label
  line end point in TAB files.

- Fixed writing MIF header: for decimal fields, an extra field of type 
  logical with same name was always added because of a missing break; (Kieron)

- Added support for reading seamless TAB files (TABSeamless class)

- Fixed problem creating new files with mixed case extensions (e.g. ".Tab")


Version 1.0.4 - (2000-11-14)
----------------------------

- Fixed a problem writing indexes - When a new entry was inserted at the 
  beginning of an index node (changing this node's key) then the parent was 
  not properly updated and some records were not queriable through that index.

- Handle '\t' just like a space when parsing mif files.

- Fixed MIFFile::GotoFeature() to avoid calling ResetReading() before moving 
  forward.

- Fixed writing of drawing tool blocks - when more than 512 bytes worth of
  drawing tool info had to be written, an error was produced instead of
  automatically allocating a new block, resulting in a truncated file.


Version 1.0.3 - (2000-10-19)
----------------------------

- Fixed reading of MAPCoordBlocks to accept text strings that overlap on
  2 data blocks.

- Added graceful recovery from NULL OGRSpatialReference pointers in 
  mitab_capi.cpp, and mitab_spatialref.cpp (NFW).

- Added what I hope to be working support for NonEarth translation 
  (into LOCAL_CS in WKT format) (NFW).

- Initialize m_dWidth to 0 in TABText constructor. (NFW)

- Made TABFile::GetBounds() return bounds corresponding to the +/- 1e9 
  integer coordinate limits instead of using min/max int. coord. from header


Version 1.0.2 - (2000-10-03)
----------------------------

- Avoid warnings building with gcc -Wall -O2 (NFW).

- Modified generation of .MAP spatial index to generate a balanced tree
  instead of the old 'chained list of nodes' that exceeded the 255 levels
  limit on the tree depth with files with > 100,000 objects.
  There would still be room for improvement by implementing splitting of
  object data blocks.

- Handle m_nOriginQuadrant value of 0 the same way as quadrant 3

- Added bDeletedFlag to TABFeature with get/set methods

- Maintain and/or compute values of regions and polyline center/label point
  (Used to always use the center of the MBR and this was not correct)

- Fixes for old Version 100 files:
   - Set valid Scale/displacement when reading V100 .map header.
     Use m_nCoordPrecision to define scale since scale in header is 0.
   - Accept "FORMAT: DBF" in .tab header file.

- Made all open() methods completely case-insensitive on filenames on Unix
  (added TABAdjustCaseSensitiveFilename())

- Added new MapInfo 6.0 datums in datum list.

- Added OGR Feature Style String support when reading

- Added support for writing arcs, ellipses and rectangles using the C API

- Flushed tab2mif.cpp and mif2tab.cpp.  There is now a single tab2tab.cpp 
  conversion program that can generate both TAB or MIF output, depending 
  on output filename extension

- Added #define MITAB_VERSION for apps that want to report library version.


Version 1.0.1 - (2000-04-21)
----------------------------

- Added C API documentation (mitab_capi.cpp) + functions to read vertices
  and field information and included C API in public release.

- Modified fltering of new table field name to accept extended chars with
  accents. 


Version 1.0 - (2000-03-26)
--------------------------

- Changed to use same MIT/X-Consortium license as other CPL + OGR libs.

- Fixed problem opening datasets with 0 features in them.

- Added support for reading TAB datasets with "Table Type DBF"... only 
  type "NATIVE" was supported until now.

- Produce only a warning when unsupported feature types encountered in the 
  .MAP file, and return a valid feature with a NONE geometry.

- Done more tests (and required changes) to fix the way the quadrant
  setting affects the way to read arc angles... hopefully it's right
  this time!

- TABText objects now return their text string with any "\n" escaped on
  2 chars  (i.e. "\"+"n").  TABText::SetText() also expects newlines to
  be escaped in the string it receives.

- Fixed some projection problems, including possible crashes with some
  9999 datums with big parameter values or with some unrecognized projections.

- Outside/inside ring relationship from a TABRegion's OGRPolygon is now
  properly written to the .MAP file's coord block section header.  
  Prior to MapInfo 5.0, this info was ignored, but now it has to be valid 
  otherwise some parts of a region won't be displayed properly in MI5.0

- Added support to write indexed fields and create joined tables (TABView).

- Added validation on field names (no special chars) on write and 
  produce a warning if name had to be fixed.

- Added support for V450 object types with num_points > 32767 and for
  pen width in points.  
  This also resulted in changes to the ITABFeaturePen methods, mainly the 
  Get/SetPenStyle() method has been removed since this style value was 
  actually a part of the point width value.  
  Finally, the 'style' parameter was also removed in the 
  mitab_c_set_pen() C API method.

- Support for Version 450 objects forced creation of version 500 .MAP files
  with 1024 bytes header (.MAP version 400 were produced before).

- MIF format now reads and writes bounds in coordsys (used to ignore them)


Version 0.2 - (1999-12-20)
--------------------------

 - Added TABView class to support views on pairs of .TAB files (read-only)
    - Currently supports only 2 tables with a many-to-1 relation through
      an integer field.

 - Added GetFeatureCountByType() method.  Current implementation does
   not work (returns all zeros) for MIF files

 - Added static ImapInfoFile::SmartOpen() to automatically detect file type,
   open a new file for read and return a new object of the appropriate
   type (TABFile/TABView/MIFFile) to handle it.

 - Changed TABFile::Open(), MIFFile::Open() to use a bTestOpenNoError flag

 - OGRMIDDataSource/OGRMIDDriver were removed.  Now all file types
   handled by MITAB go through the OGRTABDataSource/OGRTABDriver interface

 - Fixed problem reading/writing dates (bytes were reversed)
        Also, Dates are now returned as "YYYYMMDD", and accepted as one
        of "YYYY/MM/DD", "DD/MM/YYYY", or "YYYYMMDD"

 - Fixed TABFile::GetBounds() that could sometimes return Min values > Max

 - Rounded rectangles with radius bigger than MBR: we used to return a
   corrected radius value, but it's now changed to return the real radius
   value (even if it's too big) since this is what MapInfo appears to do
   when exporting from TAB to MIF

 - Fixed some problems that had appeared following a change in OGR's
   addGeometry()... use the new addGeometryDirectly() + more error checking.

 - TABRegions geometry now returned as OGRMultiPolygon instead of OGRPolygon
   with multiple rings.  This change had to be done because OGRPolygons
   MUST have only one outer ring with a set of inner rings, and this
   cannot be guaranteed to be the case with a MapInfo file.
   Also added TABRegion::GetNumRings() and TABRegion::GetRing() to 
   make it simpler to manipulate the complex geometry as if it was a 
   simple collection of rings which is actually what we have in the 
   MapInfo model.

 - Fixed some problems with MIF generation of Float fields and PLINE MULTIPLE

 - Run a bunch of read/write tests for both .TAB and .MIF through Purify...
   fixed all memory leaks found.

Version 0.1 - (1999-12-04)
--------------------------

 - First official pre-release version

 - Still lacks good API docs.
