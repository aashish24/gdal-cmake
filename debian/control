Description: Geospatial Data Abstraction Library
 GDAL is a translator library for raster geospatial data formats
 that is released under an Open Source license. As a library, it
 presents a single abstract data model to the calling application
 for all supported formats. The related OGR library (which lives
 within the GDAL source tree) provides a similar capability for
 simple features vector data.
