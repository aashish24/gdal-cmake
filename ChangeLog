	--without-ogr.

	* Improved ld -shared / CXX -shared testing to preserve existing
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH incase it is needed for something like the C++
	support shared library.

	semantics.

===============================================================================

	* Added FITS support for "byte scaled" files.

2001-03-08  Simon Perkins  <simes@genie.lanl.gov>

	* Added support for reading and	writing metadata to FITS files.
	Upon opening a FITS file, all non trivial headers are read from
	the file and stored in the metadata store. Upon closing the FITS
	file, any metadata associated with a name that is 8 characters or
	less long, is written to the FITS file. The driver attempts to
	guess the type of the metadata (double, long, logical or string)
	and calls the appropriate fits update functions.
