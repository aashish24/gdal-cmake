<title>GDAL FAQ</title>

<ol>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<li> <b>What's this OGR Stuff?</b><p>

The gdal/ogr tree holds source for a vector IO library inspired by
OpenGIS Simple Features.  In theory it is separate from GDAL, but currently
they reside in the same source tree and are somewhat entangled.  More
information can be found at
<a href="http://ogr.maptools.org/">http://ogr.maptools.org</a>.  It is 
my plan to properly fold OGR into GDAL properly at some point
in the future.  Then GDAL will be a raster and vector library. <p>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<li> <b>How do I add support for a new format?</b><p>

To some extent this is now covered by the
<a href="gdal_drivertut.html">GDAL Driver Implementation Tutorial</a>.<p>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<li> <a name="license"><b>What exactly was the license terms for GDAL?</b></a><p>

The following terms are the same as X windows is released under, and is
generally known as the "MIT License".  It is intended to give you permission
to do whatever you want with the GDAL source, including building propietary
commercial software, without further permission from me, or requirement to
distribute your source code.  A few portions of GDAL under under slightly
different terms.  For instance the libpng, libjpeg, libtiff, and libgeotiff 
license terms may vary slightly though I don't think any of them differ
in any significant way.<p>

<li> <b>What are ``Well Known Text'' projections, and how do I use them?</b><p>

OpenGIS's <i>Well Known Text</i> is a textual format for defining coordinate
systems.  It is loosely based on the EPSG coordinate systems model.  While
GDAL itself just passes these definitions around as text strings, there is
also an OGRSpatialReference class in gdal/ogr for manipulating them and
a linkage to <a href="http://www.remotesensing.org/proj">PROJ.4</a> for 
transforming between coordinate systems.  The
OGRSpatialReference, and PROJ.4 linkaged (but not PROJ.4 itself) is
linked into the GDAL shared library by default.  More documentation on WKT
and OGRSpatialReference can be found in the 
<a href="http://gdal.velocet.ca/projects/opengis/ogrhtml/osr_tutorial.html">
OGR Projections Tutorial</a>.<p>


<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<li> <b>Can I reproject rasters with GDAL?</b><p>

Yes, you can use the <a href="gdal_utilities.html#gdalwarp">gdalwarp</a> 
utility program or programmatically use the GDALWarpOperation class described
in the <a href="warptut.html">Warp API Tutorial</a>.
